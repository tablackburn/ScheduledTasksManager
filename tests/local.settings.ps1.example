# ScheduledTasksManager Integration Test Configuration
# Copy this file to local.settings.ps1 and customize as needed
# local.settings.ps1 is gitignored and will not be committed

# Integration tests use the JSON config file by default
# This file is for additional environment-specific overrides

# OPTIONAL: Override integration test config path
# $env:STM_INTEGRATION_CONFIG = 'C:\path\to\custom\integration-test-config.json'

# OPTIONAL: Remote Hyper-V host for lab deployment
# $env:STM_REMOTE_HYPER_V_HOST = 'yourserver.domain.com'
# $env:STM_REMOTE_CREDENTIAL = (Get-Credential -Message 'Enter credentials for remote Hyper-V host')

# OPTIONAL: Skip lab start/stop during test runs (for faster iteration)
# $env:STM_SKIP_LAB_LIFECYCLE = 'true'

# USAGE:
# Before running integration tests, run:
#   . ./tests/local.settings.ps1
# Or the build system will automatically source this file
